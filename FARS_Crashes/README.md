# Fast Lane, Fragile Lives: Evaluating Risk Factors For Non-Motorists Killed by Vehicles.

## Objectives

The killing of pedestrians, cyclists, and other users of micromobility devices by motor vehicles has been an increasingly pressing issue. Various city and local governments have pursued "Vision Zero" campaigns to implement systems to prevent all traffic-related deaths. A core focus of a Vision Zero project is strategically targeting resources and efforts towards groups, either of people or places, that have the highest risk for causing traffic-related fatalities. In this analysis, I utilize the data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to identify risk factors associated with traffic fatalities, focusing on the fatalities of non-motorists caused by a motor vehicle in some capacity. 

## Data

I downloaded raw data from the FARS FTP site for the year 2023 in .csv format. For the the ncsa_makes and restraints tables, their numerical codes and respective names were taken from the text of the FARS Analytical User's Manual. For counties, FARS utilizes the General Service Administration's (GSA) Geographic Location Codes (GLCs). The counties table utilizes data taken directly from the GSA's dataset of GLCs in the United States.

Using MySQL, I created tables and imported data from the .csv files into them. Only a small selection of data fields were kept from the original files.

Since these datasets were likely extracted from a relational database, certain modifications were necessary to import them back into a database while maintaining integrity and reducing redundancy. For example, the accidents, vehicles, and person files all contain repeating information about the date/time of their associated crash, and hence this information was removed to only exist in the crashes table. Oftentimes, unknown or unreported data was given a numeric code (i.e. For example, each make or group of makes in the NCSA Makes columns of the dataset represent a make, but there is also a code "99" for "Unknown Make."). Such codes would not be suitable to include in dimensional tables such as ncsa_makes, states, counties, and restraints, and hence they were not included in the dimensional tables and were converted to null values in the facts tables. 

As for database design, I created unique ID columns for the crashes, vehicles, and people tables (crash_id, vehicle_id, and person_id, respectively). However, these unique IDs do not associate entities between tables. Composites of st_case, veh_no, and per_no connect crashes, vehicles, and people. Adding primary/foreign key references among these, however, presented issues. The foreign key associating a person to a vehicle is a composite of st_case and veh_no (a person was in vehicle 1, 2, or 3 of crash 10001, 10002, or 10003). However, a person can also have veh_no = 0, indicating they were not in a vehicle. However, no entry in the vehicles table will ever have veh_no = 0, hence adding a foreign key constraint referencing the vehicles table in the people table would invalidate those entries. For the purposes of this analysis, and since there is not an intention to add/delete further entities in this, I avoided adding foreign key constraints to the tables.

See the following SQL code used to create the FARS_Crashes schema and tables, as well as to upload the data:

## Methods

Using a series of SQL queries to the FARS_Crashes database, I analyzed trends about non-motorist fatalities as well as the drivers involved in such incidents. This includes the following, each linking to the corresponding SQL query. Below each is the result table from executing that query.

## Analysis

Significant trends emerge based on this analysis. In 2023, there were over twice as many non-motorists killed during nighttime hours (6,058) as during daytime hours (2,700). I also found that men were more frequently the drivers involved in such fatalities (5,873 male drivers compared to 2,318 female drivers). These analyses, and analyses in a similar vein, can help organizations target efforts and resources to minimize traffic fatality risks, either through systemic or infrastructural changes (i.e. installing additional lighting at high-risk intersections or promoting awareness of the value of reflective clothing or lights when travelling in the evening or night) or through targeted outreach campaigns (i.e. targeting young men with the highest risk of driving recklessly for awareness campaigns). 

## Reflections

As I went through this project, I realized the challenge of taking files exported from a database and customized for use by end-users and reverting it back to a database. However, one of my key objective with this specific project was to use SQL. Were it not for this specific desire, using Excel or Python would have been generally more straightforward.

Having said that, I think there's something valuable about trying to envision what the source of publicly available datasets might look like. In doing this and combing through the FARS technical manual, I learned a lot about the data collection process for fatal crashes, and perhaps how that translates into data storage and structure decisions. 

There are many other analyses that can be done here - the average speed of vehicles involved in these crashes, road and weather conditions, or alcohol/drug involvement. As I explored the technical manual, I came across, as I did with my other projects, the challenges of data quality when the source of your data is from a high stress, high tension situation such as a fatal car crash where the people documenting and submitting data only have second-hand knowledge of the event. For example, I avoided analyses relating to drug/alcohol use due to a warning, in the manual, about many nuances and cautions when it came to interpreting that data. This is to some extent fine: I would prefer the law enforcement and emergency medical service staff involved in a crash I were involved in to save lives, clear debris, manage traffic, and so on even at the expense of some data ambiguity. But it does lend to a question: how do we balance the demands of high tension situations with our desire to understand or forecast those events with data?
