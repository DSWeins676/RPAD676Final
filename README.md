Personal vehicles are essential for both work and leisure, especially when public transportation is not readily available. However, vehicles also impose significant costs, in both purchase and upkeep, on their owners, and this burden is felt more for households/families in lower socioeconomic brackets. Using a combination of New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) vehicle registration data and demographic/economic data from the U.S. Census Bureau, this project seeks to explore trends in vehicle ownership as well as relationships between vehicles and socioeconomic indicators across geographic locations in New York State. This may reveal trends that guide further research and analysis directions about the state of vehicles in New York.

Local jurisdictions and state agencies use different penalties for various infractions to enforce compliance with New York State's Vehicle and Traffic Law (VTL). Some of these apply to one's driving privilege, while some apply to a vehicle's registration, and others apply to both. Registration penalties can occur due to issues such as failing to keep current automobile insurance, frequently violating parking codes or automated traffic safety measures (i.e. red light cameras) without paying their associated fees, or failing to pay outstanding bridge/tunnel/thruway tolls. Using publicly available vehicle registration data from the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles, which has the authority to place these penalties, I created a Tableau dashboard to explore the frequency of registration enforcement measures, both as a total and as a percent of total vehicles, either within the entire state or filtered by one or multiple county/counties. The dashboard also displays the frequency of these enforcement measures grouped by the affected vehicle's make. This visualization could reveal trends and tendencies in both the frequency with which drivers infringe some of these laws or fail to pay their fines, as well as the frequency with which local governments pursue these enforcement mechanisms against drivers. Further exploration could help determine the causes of higher infraction rates in certain areas, which could then guide future policies, enforcement efforts, or awareness campaigns to increase compliance and ensure New York's drivers can continue using their vehicles without interruption.

The killing of pedestrians, cyclists, and other users of micromobility devices by motor vehicles has been an increasingly pressing issue. Various city and local governments have pursued "Vision Zero" campaigns to implement systems to prevent all traffic-related deaths. A core focus of a Vision Zero project is strategically targeting resources and efforts towards groups, either of people or places, that have the highest risk for causing traffic-related fatalities. In this analysis, I utilize the data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to identify risk factors associated with traffic fatalities, focusing on the fatalities of non-motorists caused by a motor vehicle in some capacity.
